# Responsive Design & Flexbox!!

### Learning Objectives
- Define the flexible box module (flexbox!)
- Give an example of a problem solved by flexbox
- Contrast flex containers and flex items
- Describe the difference between the main axis and the cross axis
- Use flexbox to solve common design problems without using hacks

# Intro to Flexbox

Flexbox is short for "The CSS3 Flexible Box Module". From [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes), here's a definiton:

> Flexbox ... is a layout mode providing for the arrangement of elements on a page such that the elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. ... The defining aspect of the flex layout is the ability to alter its items' width and/or height to best fit in the available space on any display device.

### Flex context vs block context

- Up to this point we've been working with the block context -- `display: block;`. This means that in order to position things, we needed to float them, use clearfix, etc.
- Flexbox introduces a new context: `display: flex;`.
- Elements with `display: flex;` have, largely, an external block context -- they exist in the document flow like any other kind of element.
- Internally, they create a new type of context that has its own properties.

## Flex containers and flex items

### A flex _container_ is an element that creates a flex context.

From the [W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-containers):

> A flex container establishes a new flex formatting context for its contents. This is the same as establishing a block formatting context, except that flex layout is used instead of block layout. For example, floats do not intrude into the flex container ... Flex containers form a containing block for their contents exactly like block containers do.

The flex context works a little differently from the ordinary block context that is the default of the document flow. A number of properties are different or do not apply.

- `float` and `clear` don't have any effect on flex items
- `vertical-align` has no effect on a flex item
- Some pseudoelements, like `::first-line` and `::first-letter`, don't apply to flex containers.

### A flex _item_ is an element that exists within a flex context.

From the [W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-items):

> Each in-flow child of a flex container becomes a flex item, and each contiguous run of text that is directly contained inside a flex container is wrapped in an anonymous flex item.

From the [W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-items):

> A flex item establishes a new formatting context for its contents. The type of this formatting context is determined by its display value, as usual. However, flex items themselves are flex-level boxes, not block-level boxes: they participate in their container‚Äôs flex formatting context, not in a block formatting context.

## Flex Properties and Axes (axises? axes?)

There's a long list of CSS properties that are specific to either flex containers or flex items. We'll go through a few of them, and then you'll get practice with the rest during lab.

### Main Axis, Cross Axis

A lot of the power in flexbox comes from the ability to switch which axis is which with just one property.

### üìö Flex Container Properties

([Taken largely from CSSTricks complete guide to flexbox.](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))

<dl>
  <dt><code>display</code></dt>
  <dd>In order to create a flex context, you must declare it using <code>display: flex;</code>. (Note: You may also occasionally see <code>display: inline-flex;</code> but I have not had to use this. If you want to know what it does, I encourage you to mess around.)</dd>

  <dt><code>flex-direction</code></dt>
  <dd><code>flex-direction</code> establishes which axis is the main axis and which is the cross axis. The possible values are <code>row</code>, <code>row-reverse</code>, <code>column</code>, and <code>column-reverse</code>. The behavior of other properties are dependent on <code>flex-direction</code>.</dd>

  <dt><code>flex-wrap</code></dt>
  <dd>By default, flex items all try to fit into one line. <code>flex-wrap</code> changes this behavior, allowing items to wrap to new lines. The possible values are <code>nowrap</code>, <code>wrap</code>, <code>wrap-reverse</code>.</dd>

  <dt><code>flex-flow</code></dt>
  <dd>A shorthand property for <code>flex-direction</code> and <code>flex-wrap</code>. The default value is <code>row nowrap</code>. There's a bunch of different possible values -- essentially, pick one <code>flex-direction</code> value and one <code>flex-wrap</code> value and combine them.</dd>

  <dt><code>justify-content</code></dt>
  <dd>Defines the alignment and spacing along the main axis, and helps distribute extra, leftover free space. The possible values are <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>space-between</code>, and <code>space-around</code>.</dd>

  <dt><code>align-items</code></dt>
  <dd><code>align-items</code> describes how flex items are placed relative to the flex container. The possible values are <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>stretch</code> (the default), and <code>baseline</code>.</dd>

  <dt><code>align-content</code></dt>
  <dd>This aligns a flex container's lines when there's extra space on the cross axis. The available values are <code>flex-start</code>, <code>flex-end</code>, <code>center</code>, <code>stretch</code> (the default), <code>space-between</code>, and <code>space-around</code>. <b>NOTE!</b> This property has no effect unless there's more than one line of flex items.  </dd>
</dl>

### üìö Flex Item Properties

([Taken largely from CSSTricks complete guide to flexbox.](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/))

<dl>
  <dt><code>order</code></dt>
  <dd>The order in which you want flex items to appear along the main access. The default is 0. Negative numbers are allowed.</dd>

  <dt><code>flex-grow</code></dt>
  <dd>Defines the proportion of the space in the container that the flex item will take up. For ex, if all flex items in a flex container have a <code>flex-grow</code> property of 1, they will all take up equal width. If one of the children has <code>flex-grow: 2;</code>, it will be twice as wide as the others.</dd>

  <dt><code>flex-shrink</code></dt>
  <dd>Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.</dd>

  <dt><code>flex-basis</code></dt>
  <dd>Defines the default size of an element. You can use any CSS unit of measurement -- percent, pixels, em, etc.</dd>

  <dt><code>flex</code></dt>
  <dd>This is a shorthand property that combines <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and <code>flex-basis</code>. It's recommended to use <code>flex</code> instead of setting the other properties individually. You have to include <code>flex-grow</code>, but the other two parameters are optional. Usually you'll include <code>flex-grow</code> and <code>flex-basis</code>, like this: <code>flex: 1 300px;</code>.</dd>

  <dt><code>align-self</code></dt>
  <dd>This allows the default alignment (as set by <code>align-items</code>) to be overridden for individual items.</dd>
</dl>

## üöÄ Lab 1: [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)! üê∏

For this lab, you'll be getting more acquainted with the flex properties, and applying them to flex items and flex containers. Hit the link above and start helping the frogs find their lily pads! (Feel free to work in pairs or groups!!)

## üöÄ Lab 2: Practice practice practice!

In the `flexbox-layout-challenge` directory of this repo, you'll find a `layouts.pdf` file containing five mockups for five different site layouts. In groups of three, you are to construct one web page for each layout in the diagram.

The first two `index.html` and `style.css` files have been created for you. You must create your own files for the remaining three layouts.

As there are no pixel or percentage values stated on the mockup, you should use your best judgement to match the spec as closely as possible.
